## Introduction {#main}

Previous work used RNA-Seq and Kraken filtering to demonstrate that Ranavirus infection resulted in a differential abundance of bacterial transcripts from specific bacterial communities.
I have applied the same Kraken filtering techniques to RNA-Seq datasets from tail fin (TF) and olfactory epithelium (OE) tissues from pre-metamorphic bullfrog tadpoles exposed to either E2, T4, or T3.
This data will be paired with traditional 16S rRNA sequencing methods to examine the effects these exposures have on the Rana catesbeiana bacterial and viral communities.

Microbiome and why study it?
Environmental changes don’t just impact large animals, but also effect microbes that play pivotal role in an ecosystem. 
Every niche/surface/environment has a specific microbial community which contribute to the function of the system. 

Why using frog to study environmental pollutants?

Bullfrog developmental models are very sensitive to exogenous T3, as well as their sex ratios are affected by endocrine disruption in the environment. 
Therefore bullfrogs’ skin can act as a sensitive model to study effects of hormones and disruptors on the environment. 
Frog metamorphosis represents the most accessible and striking example of TH action. 
This process is entirely dependent upon TH and completion of this developmental period requires a rise in TH levels from zero baseline levels found in the premetamorphic tadpole. 
TH levels naturally increase from premetamorphosis through prometamorphosis to reach maximal levels at metamorphic climax at which time rapid, overt remodeling of the tadpole into a froglet occurs. 
Virtually all tissues are targets for TH action, yet the end result includes diverse responses e.g. complete tail resorption, liver reprogramming, brain remodeling, and limb growth. 
These changes are precociously induced in the premetamorphic tadpole by exogenous administration of T3 or T4

Our frog species, Ranidae frogs
The current OECD 21 day assay evaluates the whole organismal response with assessment of external morphological criteria at days 7 and 21 and qualitative assessment of thyroid gland morphology at day 21. It relies upon highly inbred laboratory strains of Xenopus species that are not relevant to the North American environment.


This work is part of the WEC project in which the response of pre-metamorphic tadpoles is measured to 3 different hormone treatments: Thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and 17-beta-estradiol (E2). 
T4 is the precursor to the more bioactive thyroid hormone, T3. 
E2 here, acts a control group for hormone exposure, but is also used to monitor potential crosstalk between thyroid- and estrogen-mediated pathways.
