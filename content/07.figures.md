![**The tadpole and frog microbiomes are distinct and seperate from controls**. Using Bray-Curtis distances of the microbiomes plotted on a 2-axis NMDS, 3 distinct clusters formed, each representing a unique dataset.

The skin microbiomes (X-axis) of the tadpoles and froglets, classified according to their stage of development (bottom categories), are composed of 9 major phyla. A marked increase in Verrucomicrobia is seen as the tadpoles matures into froglets.  ](images/barplot_phylumnatural.png){#fig:barplot_phylumnatural width="6.5in"}

![**Relative Abundance of 16S Microbiomes at the Bacterial Phylum Level**. The relative abundance of the top 10 bacterial phyla present across all samples represents >99% of all reads sequenced. The  tadpole skin microbiome (labelled 1-23) consisted of predominately Proteobacteria (Purple). However, as life stage progresses, froglets are dominated by Verrucomicrobia. The relative distribution of phyla in the positive control (labelled POS) is as expected. Sterile swabs (labelled SSC) and negative controls (labelled NSC) have <2k reads on average. ](images/phylum_label.png){#fig:phylum_combined width="6.5in"}
